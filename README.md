## Cryptopals Crypto Challenge Solutions in Rust

Mohit Cheppudira <mohit@muthanna.com> 2023

This repository consists of my documented [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) solutions to the original [Cyptopals Cryptography Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) (formerly known as the Matsano Crypto Challenges).

This is a work in progress. See my [solutions in Go here](https://github.com/0xfe/cryptopals).

# To Run

```sh
RUST_LOG=info cargo run

# skip slow challenges
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- --fast

```
